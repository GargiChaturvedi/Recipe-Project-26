Finally, the _recipe_:

- Add all _spices_ in the _mashed potato_
- Wet the _bread_ a little with _water_ and squeeze the bread such that the entire water squeezes out
- Mix both _wet bread_ and _mashed potato_ and form a _dough_ 
- Apply few drops of _oil_ on your palm
- Take a small ball of _dough_ and _mould_ it in your desired shape or use a _stencil_ for precision
- Meanwhile, put _kadhai_ on the stove and pour _oil_ in the kadhai which will be used for frying
- Turn on the _gas_ on _medium-sim_
- _Deep fry_ the _shapes_ you created with dough until they are _golden-brown_
- Remove them from the kadhai and serve on your _platter_
